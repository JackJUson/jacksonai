I am part of Telstra's Payments team within the FinTech capability engineering sector—a highly technical group responsible for developing and maintaining the **backend APIs and interconnected microservices** that support **all payment flows across the entire company**.

In our ecosystem, we manage a highly distributed architecture composed of Java (Spring Boot & Play Framework) microservices. These services run in **Docker containers**, orchestrated by **Kubernetes** and deployed on **AWS EC2**, ensuring scalability, resilience, and fault-tolerance.

We also operate a range of **serverless components**, including AWS **Lambda functions** (written in Node.js and Python), **Glue jobs** and workflows, and event-driven triggers that coordinate data processing pipelines. These services tie into **DynamoDB**, **SQL databases**, and **S3 storage**, while **ElastiCache (Redis)** accelerates data retrieval for performance-critical paths.

Our team integrates with external fintech systems like **Braintree's GraphQL APIs** and **SFX**, handling diverse data types—transactions, customers, and merchant account details—across multiple domains.

On the infrastructure and DevOps side, we implement **Infrastructure as Code** using **Terraform**, manage secure deployment pipelines via **Bamboo CI/CD**, and version control with **GitLab/Git**. We handle networking, security, and compliance with tools like **IAM**, **VPCs**, **security groups**, and **load balancers**.

For observability, we rely on **New Relic**, **Splunk**, and **AWS CloudWatch** to monitor system performance, track API metrics, troubleshoot production incidents, and ensure everything is healthy and efficient.

This role has broadened my expertise in building **scalable microservices**, orchestrating complex AWS environments, designing data-driven pipelines, and adopting DevOps best practices—all while working in **Agile cross-functional teams**. I collaborate closely with architects, QA engineers, and stakeholders to deliver fast, reliable payments infrastructure with enterprise-grade quality and security.
