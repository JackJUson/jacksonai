As a **Casual Academic** for **COMP6080 – Web Front-end Programming** at UNSW, I support students in mastering modern web development workflows and concepts through practical, theory-informed teaching.

Key responsibilities include:

- **Delivering weekly tutorials and help sessions**, where I guide students through fundamental and advanced web technologies—**HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, along with **UI/UX principles**, **accessibility**, and **front-end testing**. This maps directly to the course's emphasis on delivering modern, industry-standard front-end skills.

- **Moderating the course forum** and providing targeted academic support—offering clear explanations on debugging, best practices, and asynchronous programming patterns drawn from real-world development environments.

- **Designing, marking, and providing feedback** for assignments and exams—ensuring fairness, clarity, and consistency with marking guidelines, while encouraging learning through constructive critique.

- **Collaborating on course delivery and improvements**, contributing to discussions around curriculum enhancements, aligning course content with industry developments in front-end technologies and teaching strategies.

This role has deepened my technical teaching abilities and honed my communication skills. It's deeply rewarding to help students overcome challenging assignments—especially in a course known for being intensive yet transformative in its introduction to React, testing, and UI design.

Beyond university teaching, I also provide private tutoring for students who reach out to me directly. Whether it's helping someone prepare for an exam, debug a stubborn program, or simply build their confidence as a programmer, I really enjoy tailoring my explanations to different learning styles. I see teaching not just as sharing knowledge, but as a way to inspire curiosity and build problem-solving skills — qualities that are crucial in software engineering.
