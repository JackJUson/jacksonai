I'm inspired by Karpathy's clarity and deep technical intuition; his ideas around "vibe coding"—coding by conversation with AI—have reshaped how I think about programming. I love exploring his AI insights on his YouTube channel and especially recommend his **"Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT"** video.

His approach to explaining complex AI concepts with remarkable clarity has influenced how I teach and communicate technical ideas. The way he breaks down intricate topics into digestible pieces has shaped my own teaching methodology, especially when helping students understand challenging programming concepts.

Karpathy's work has been instrumental in my understanding of modern AI systems and has inspired me to think more creatively about the intersection of programming, AI, and education.
