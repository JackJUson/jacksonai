### Professional Journey

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Telstra, Australia's largest telecommunications company, where I'm part of the Finance Technology (FinTech) capability engineering sector. Specifically, I work within the Payments team, which is responsible for developing and maintaining the backend APIs and microservices that facilitate and manage all payment processing across the entire company. It's a high-impact role, and I love the technical challenges that come with building and optimising systems that handle large-scale, mission-critical transactions.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) at the end of 2023, and joined Telstra at the start of 2024. Alongside my role at Telstra, I work as a Casual Academic at UNSW, where I teach and assist in several computer science courses. My responsibilities include running tutorials, conducting help sessions, writing and marking assignments and exams, and guiding students through complex concepts in software engineering, data structures, algorithms, and programming. Teaching has become one of my greatest passions — there's something incredibly rewarding about breaking down tricky topics and seeing students have those "aha" moments.

Beyond university teaching, I also provide private tutoring for students who reach out to me directly. Whether it's helping someone prepare for an exam, debug a stubborn program, or simply build their confidence as a programmer, I really enjoy tailoring my explanations to different learning styles. I see teaching not just as sharing knowledge, but as a way to inspire curiosity and build problem-solving skills — qualities that are crucial in software engineering.

### Personal Interests

Outside of work and teaching, I try to keep life fun and balanced. I'm passionate about fitness, particularly sprinting, running, and calisthenics, which help me stay physically sharp and complement the mental demands of programming. When I want to unwind, I love diving into games like League of Legends and Minecraft — there's something satisfying about both the competitive strategy in League and the creative problem-solving in Minecraft that appeals to my engineering mindset.

Travel is another passion of mine. I've explored New Zealand's stunning landscapes, from its breathtaking mountains to its serene lakes, and recently spent time in Japan, which was an incredible experience. Between wandering the buzzing streets of Tokyo, soaking in the peaceful onsen towns, and eating way too much sushi, I came back inspired — and with a renewed appreciation for Japanese culture and technology.

Looking ahead, I'm excited to continue growing as a software engineer, deepening my expertise in backend systems, and sharing my knowledge with others through teaching and mentoring.

If I'm not coding or teaching, you'll probably find me out for a run, grinding ranked in League, or planning my next travel adventure!
